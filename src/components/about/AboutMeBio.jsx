        I'm Shamil, a Computer Science grad with a passion for
          transforming lines of code into seamless user experiences. When I'm
          not busy debugging, you can
          find me dreaming up the next big thing in web development. I
          specialize in making the web a more beautiful place with my React
          wizardry. From sleek front-end designs to smooth user interactions,
          I'm all about creating websites that not only look good but feel good
          to use. Oh, and I have a minor addiction to coffee and memes, so feel
          free to send any my way!
